What to Use Joi for and When to Use It  

## Joi is an object schema description language and validator for JavaScript objects. If you're wondering why you would need to validate JavaScript Objects, this document will give you a brief introduction on why data validation is needed and its applications. Let’s say for example, you have a web form that ask users to input their username, password, date of birth, and email. How would you prevent users from inputting gibberish into your form? You wouldn’t want to deal with submissions that are meaningless or missing parts of data. This is where data validation comes into play. Joi allows for constraints to be placed on JavaScript Object properties.
